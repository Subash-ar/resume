Welcome to the ResumeBuilder API project! This project provides a comprehensive backend solution for building, managing, and maintaining resumes. It is designed to be easily integrated into your resume-building applications.

Project Overview
The ResumeBuilder API is a RESTful web service that allows users to:

Create new resumes
Update existing resumes
Delete resumes
Retrieve resumes by various criteria (e.g., by user, by job title)
This API is built using Java and Spring Boot and follows best practices for RESTful API design, including proper use of HTTP methods, status codes, and error handling.
